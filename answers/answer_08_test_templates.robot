### Exercise 1
# Convert these two tests into a templated test by:
# 1. Creating a custom keyword that runs the test (think about what you want to parameterize)
# 2. Defining this keyword as a Test Template
#    (can you find out how to use the username in the log statement, too?)
# 3. Specifying the iterations (test cases) in the *** Test Cases *** section
Check If John has more than one account  john  demo
Check If Parasoft has more than one account  parasoft  demo
